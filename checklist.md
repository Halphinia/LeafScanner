Love it. Here’s a practical, no-code checklist that gets LeafScanner from “idea” → “hosted Flask app on Render,” while forcing learning and preventing scope creep. Each item has a clear outcome so you know when it’s done.

# LeafScanner—Ship-It Checklist (no code, just steps)

## 0) Define MVP and guardrails (1 hour)

* [ ] Write a 5-line MVP statement: “Upload image → detect red 1 cm square → compute leaf area (cm²) → run OCR on handwritten tag → rename image → return results & downloadable CSV.”
* [ ] Make a **stop list** (things you will NOT do for MVP): multi-leaf images, batch zip uploads, fancy UI, model fine-tuning, database.
* [ ] Create a tiny **acceptance test**: 10 images from the lab that represent easy/medium/hard cases. This is your fixed benchmark.

**Outcome:** A pinned `MVP.md` with scope + acceptance set.

---

## 1) Dataset & ground truth (half day)

* [ ] Assemble 30–50 representative images (varied lighting, leaf sizes, orientations).
* [ ] For 10 of them (the benchmark set), record a manual “truth” area (use ImageJ or the lab’s current method) and the correct filename/label.
* [ ] Put them in `data/benchmark/` and write a **README** describing how they were measured.

**Outcome:** `data/benchmark/` with images + a CSV of true area and label.

---

## 2) Image calibration via the red square (1 day)

Goal: robustly measure pixel-to-cm conversion using the red 1 cm square.

* [ ] Decide on a color space you’ll try first (HSV or LAB) and write down why.
* [ ] Define 2–3 **detection strategies** to try (threshold by hue/sat; contour shape check ~square; aspect ratio and area bounds; fallback: Hough lines).
* [ ] Define **failure rules** (e.g., if multiple candidates, choose the one with nearest-square ratio and expected area; if none, surface a clear error).
* [ ] Acceptance: on your 10-image benchmark, you recover a scale with ≤3% error in side length on 9/10 images.

**Outcome:** A documented procedure for detecting/calibrating from the red square and how you’ll quantify success/failure.

---

## 3) Leaf segmentation (1–2 days)

Goal: isolate the leaf region cleanly.

* [ ] Choose one primary segmentation approach to start (e.g., color threshold in HSV on green/brown ranges + morphological cleanup).
* [ ] Define **post-processing** steps (open/close, largest-contour selection, hole filling).
* [ ] Define **edge cases** now: petiole detached, overlapping with square, glare, shadows.
* [ ] Acceptance: on benchmark images, IoU (intersection-over-union) vs a quick hand-drawn mask ≥0.85 on 8/10; visual spot-check the other 2.

**Outcome:** A written step-by-step pipeline that you can implement and test image-by-image.

---

## 4) Area computation & unit conversion (half day)

* [ ] Specify the exact formula: `leaf_area_cm2 = (leaf_mask_pixel_count) * (cm_per_pixel^2)`, where `cm_per_pixel = 1 cm / square_side_in_pixels`.
* [ ] Define **precision reporting** (e.g., round to 0.01 cm²).
* [ ] Acceptance: mean absolute % error vs your ground truth ≤5% on benchmark.

**Outcome:** A one-pager documenting your area math and acceptance threshold.

---

## 5) OCR baseline for handwritten label (1 day)

Goal: get *something* working end-to-end before fine-tuning.

* [ ] Decide on a **crop strategy** for the label region (e.g., top-right quadrant; or find high-contrast text region; keep this simple at first).
* [ ] Choose a baseline OCR (e.g., TrOCR or Tesseract) and record expected pitfalls (dashes, slashes, “Block I 7-6” vs “I 7 6”).
* [ ] Define a **post-processing** spec: allowed characters, whitespace rules, dash normalization, and a regex that valid filenames should match.
* [ ] Acceptance: ≥80% exact match on benchmark labels; others should be off by at most one character class (e.g., “–” vs “4”).

**Outcome:** Documented cropping + OCR + normalization rules and how you’ll score accuracy.

---

## 6) Error handling & human-in-the-loop (half day)

* [ ] Define how you surface failures: “Could not detect scale,” “Leaf mask low confidence,” “OCR low confidence.”
* [ ] Decide on a **manual override path** in the UI (simple text field to correct label; numeric field to override area if needed).
* [ ] Log everything to a **per-run CSV** (image name, area, scale side px, mask percent, OCR text, confidence, warnings).

**Outcome:** A short spec for your “operator workflow” so the app is usable even on bad images.

---

## 7) Flask app architecture (1 day, still no code)

* [ ] Sketch your endpoints/pages:

  * `GET /` (upload form, single image for MVP),
  * `POST /analyze` (runs pipeline, returns results),
  * `GET /download.csv` (aggregated results for the session),
  * `GET /healthz` (simple health check for Render).
* [ ] Decide where files live during processing (temp dir) and your cleanup policy.
* [ ] Decide on **max image size** and server-side resizing to keep processing predictable.
* [ ] Decide on how you’ll store per-session results (in-memory dict for MVP; no DB).

**Outcome:** A small architecture diagram + a one-page “request lifecycle” doc.

---

## 8) Local CLI first (1 day)

* [ ] Before Flask, plan a **single CLI command**: `leafscanner path/to/image.jpg → prints area & label`.
* [ ] Plan a CLI flag for debugging: `--save-masks`, `--show-bounds`.
* [ ] Acceptance: your 10 benchmark images run in a loop and produce a CSV that meets your accuracy thresholds.

**Outcome:** A test plan to prove the pipeline works *before* you add web overhead.

---

## 9) Minimal UI plan (half day)

* [ ] Wireframe one page: drag-and-drop box, file input fallback, “Analyze” button, results card (thumbnail, area, detected label, rename suggestion, warnings), and a **Download CSV** button.
* [ ] Accessibility checklist: label form fields, show errors inline, avoid tiny text.
* [ ] Acceptance: someone else in the lab can use the page without instructions.

**Outcome:** A simple layout sketch and a checklist for what appears on success/failure.

---

## 10) Reproducibility & testing (half day)

* [ ] Write down your **unit tests** (even if they’ll be tiny): scale detection on a known crop, mask pixel count on a synthetic rectangle, OCR normalization on fixed strings.
* [ ] Decide on how you’ll seed randomness (if any) and pin library versions.
* [ ] Plan to save a **debug bundle** per run (original + mask overlay + JSON of measurements) for 3 sample images.

**Outcome:** A `TESTING.md` describing exactly how you’ll verify correctness quickly.

---

## 11) Packaging & repo hygiene (half day)

* [ ] Repo layout: `app/` (Flask), `pipeline/` (image/OCR), `data/benchmark/`, `docs/`, `static/`, `templates/`.
* [ ] Write a **README** with: what it does, how to run locally, sample inputs/outputs, and one screenshot.
* [ ] Add a tiny **CHANGELOG.md** so you can summarize progress later.

**Outcome:** A professional-looking repo even before deployment.

---

## 12) Deploy on Render (1 day)

* [ ] Decide your Python version; create `requirements.txt`.
* [ ] Create a `Procfile` or define the Render start command (`gunicorn app.wsgi:app` or similar).
* [ ] Add a **/healthz** route.
* [ ] Set max upload size and request timeout in your server config (note: image processing can be spiky).
* [ ] Acceptance: public URL works; upload → results in < 10 s on benchmark images.

**Outcome:** Running URL you can share with the lab.

---

## 13) Usability polish (half day)

* [ ] Add progress/“working…” indicator on analyze.
* [ ] Highlight warnings (yellow banner) with suggested fixes (e.g., “Retake photo with less glare”).
* [ ] Include a small **FAQ** on the page (“What images work best?” with 3 bullets).

**Outcome:** Feels like a product, not a script.

---

## 14) Documentation for the lab (half day)

* [ ] One-page **“How to Photograph”** (lighting, square placement, camera angle).
* [ ] One-page **“How to Use LeafScanner”** with screenshots.
* [ ] Short **Data Quality Tips**: what to do if OCR fails, how to correct labels.

**Outcome:** Hand-off docs so others can succeed without you.

---

## 15) Stretch (only after MVP ships)

* [ ] Batch upload (zip) and batch CSV.
* [ ] OCR improvement: smarter cropping, then augmentation, then fine-tuning.
* [ ] Confidence scores + auto-flag uncertain outputs.
* [ ] Optional DB to persist runs and let users revisit results.

---

### How to keep momentum (and learn)

* Work **top-to-bottom** in this order; don’t jump ahead.
* After each section, tick the acceptance box using your benchmark images.
* Keep a `DECISIONS.md` with 1–2 sentences for each choice you make (color space, thresholds, OCR engine). This proves you understand *why*, not just *how*.

If you want, I can turn this into a 10-day schedule with daily goals (1–2 hours/day) and “exit criteria” per day.
